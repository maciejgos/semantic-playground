Introduction: The Web-based Request for Quotation (RFQ) Application aims to streamline the procurement process by providing a centralized platform for requesting and managing quotations from vendors. This application will facilitate efficient communication between buyers and suppliers, ensuring transparency, accuracy, and timeliness in the procurement process. 2. Objectives Develop a user-friendly web application for creating, submitting, and managing RFQs. Enable buyers to easily invite multiple suppliers to submit quotations for specified goods or services. Provide suppliers with a platform to view, respond to, and track RFQs. Implement features for automatic notifications, reminders, and status updates to keep all parties informed throughout the RFQ process. Ensure security and data confidentiality in handling sensitive procurement information. 3. Features and Functionalities: User Authentication: Secure login and registration for buyers and suppliers. RFQ Creation: Ability for buyers to create RFQs, specifying details such as product/service requirements, quantities, delivery deadlines, and any other relevant terms. Supplier Invitation: Buyers can invite specific suppliers or broadcast RFQs to a predefined list of approved vendors. Quotation Submission: Suppliers can view RFQs, prepare quotations, and submit them through the platform. Communication Tools: Built-in messaging system for buyers and suppliers to communicate regarding RFQ clarifications, negotiations, or other inquiries. Document Management: Support for attaching relevant documents, specifications, or additional files to RFQs and quotations. Tracking and Status Updates: Real-time tracking of RFQs and quotations, with notifications and alerts for key milestones such as submission deadlines, quote revisions, and award decisions. Reporting and Analytics: Generate reports and analytics on RFQ activity, supplier performance, response times, and other relevant metrics to facilitate decision-making and process improvements. Admin Dashboard: Administrative interface for managing users, permissions, system settings, and overseeing overall application functionality. Security Measures: Implementation of industry-standard security protocols to protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations.\"}}\n",
